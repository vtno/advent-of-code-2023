# Advent of Code 2023

Solving with Elixir + [Livebook](https://livebook.dev/). My extra constraint is to solve the problem as efficient as possible.

Each block can be run to solve each problem separately.

The only dep used is `Flow` which utilize more CPU core when computing `MapReduce` operation.
